The repository of the currently selected effect is shown on the titlebar.

The special effect file (.sef) without extension is listed in the rightside
panel. Click a file in the list to play or replay it.


MENUS

Resrepo (resource repository)
-------
list all effects [Ctrl+1] - lists all available effects
stock only       [Ctrl+2] - lists stock effects only (installation data folder)
module only      [Ctrl+3] - lists module-level effects (if a module is loaded)
campaign only    [Ctrl+4] - lists campaign-level effects (if a module with a
                            campaign is loaded)
override only    [Ctrl+5] - lists effects in override only

Note: Those aren't absolute determinations; Module, Campaign, and Override check
merely for a substring in each effect's path: "modules", "campaigns", or
"override" respectively. Stock checks merely for the absence of those strings.

I might try to figure it out for real later ...

Events
------
Play [F5] - plays or replays the currently selected effect's enabled events
Stop [F6] - stops play

Note: Only the option DoubleCharacter lists and allows disabling individual
effect-events. The following items appear on the menu only if DoubleCharacter
has been selected:

Disable all events [F7] - disables all events
Enable all events  [F8] - re-enables all events. Re-selecting the effect in the
                          list also re-enables all its events

If and only if the DoubleCharacter option is selected does a list of events
appear in the menu. The events can be toggled on or off with a click. Keypress
[Shift] when clicking to play only that event. I had to sacrifice a chicken to
get that to work ...

Note: The toolset is a difficult environment to code for - visualeffects on
weapons, for instance, do not appear to render at all and the events of various
specialeffects render at a corner of the area-tiles instead of where they're
expected to be, in the center. SPECIALEFFECT_TYPE_LIGHTNING events are notably
positioned incorrectly at 0,0 and SPECIALEFFECT_TYPE_PARTICLE_MESH can appear at
200,200 if not using DoubleCharacter. etc

OPTIONS

When View|show Options panel is activated, a panel is shown with two tabs:
Options and Events.

On the Options page three radio-buttons select how the scene will be rendered.

Double character     - renders the scene with two NPCs. This creates source
                       and target creatures, and uses their attachment-nodes as
                       appropriate.
Single character     - renders the scene with a single NPC. This applies the
                       currently selected effect to a single creature using its
                       'AppearanceSEF' property
placed effect object - renders the effect on a placed-effect object

Note: Deciding which option above to use depends on the special effect file and
the usage that you intend to put it to for NwN2 play.

Also on the Options page, the appearance for Source and Target creatures can be
selected per Appearance.2da.

Source - select the appearance for the source-creature in a Double character
         scene or for the creature in a Single character scene
Target - select the appearance for the target-creature in a Double character
         scene

Note: Only appearances that have valid skeleton- and body-files will be listed.

To the right of Source and Target are checkboxes for the female variants of the
selected appearances if they are available.

Note: Creatures are very basic. Wings and tail, etc, are not displayed.

Beneath the Source and Target dropdowns is a field to set the distance between
source and target creatures. Allowed value is 1..100.

Also, ground tiles can be toggled on and off on the Options page.

show Ground - toggles the ground on and off. Some effect-events have textures
              that only render on the ground

The currently selected effect's events will be listed on the Events page. This
is simply informational and can't be edited; if you want to edit a special
effect or any of its events, breakout the files (they are listed in the events)
and open them in the stock VFXEditor plugin or other.


BUTTONS

Play - plays the currently selected effect
Stop - stops the effect (note that sounds are handled elsewhere and won't be
       stopped unless the sound-event is set to loop)
Copy - copies the label of the currently selected special effect file to the
       Windows clipboard

filtr - toggles the effects-list filter on and off. Enter a string in search and
        click the filter button to set a filter-string. A filtered list can
        still be searched by typing a different string in search. To apply a
        different filter, enter a different string and toggle the filter button.
        The filter respects the currently selected Resrepo and vice versa


MOUSE

RMB-drag          - pans the camera up/down/left/right
RMB-drag + [Ctrl] - rotates the camera around its focal point
Mousewheel        - zooms the camera in/out

Note: The display panel must be focused to adjust the camera.


KEYBOARD

Enter  - plays the currently selected effect if the currently focused control
         doesn't handle the [Enter] key itself. Searches if search is focused
         (depress [Shift] to search ascending), or activates a button
Escape - closes the plugin

the SceneData dialog
--------------------
kL_note: I don't really understand the finer details of objects as they are
rendered to the [NetDisplayPanel]. Take what follows with a grain of salt ...

The SceneData dialog can be opened under View|scene data [Ctrl+n]. It's a
readonly dialog that's intended to show information about objects in the scene.
For the SpecialEffectsViewer, the objects are models and specialeffects. The
options DoubleCharacter, SingleCharacter, and PlacedEffectObject handle
effects differently: the DoubleCharacter option leverages toolset-code
[SEFGroup] which creates source and target creatures and can therefore handle
effects that require a target-creature; the SingleCharacter option creates only
1 creature and applies an effect only to its [AppearanceSEF] property; the
PlacedEffectOption merely creates a generic PlacedEffect and applies an effect
to it.

See OPTIONS above.

This gets tricky because effects are objects in the display-panel also - but
only while they are being actively updated by the panel. If information about
them is gathered too quickly, it will be incomplete since it takes a fraction of
a second for the panel to instantiate them; if too slowly, the objects will have
disappeared from the panel. So, to get complete information about the scene
including any effects, there is an option in the toolset under
View|Options...|Plugins|Special Effects Viewer|SceneData dialog: SceneDataDelay.
Its default value is 350 milliseconds.

I believe it should be set as fast as possible without throwing an
InvalidOperationException (see the description of the SceneDataDelay property
under toolset|View|Options...|Plugins|Special Effects Viewer). I believe it
depends on how slow or fast your CPU is: faster CPUs can handle a shorter delay.
I believe that there is an underlying issue with multi-threading in the toolset
libraries (ie, a race condition). The very minimum value is 15 milliseconds,
which is a limitation of the .NET libraries (a standard Timer can't tick faster
than about that).

The most troublesome effect I've found is fx_item_blood (SoZ) w/ 41 objects. You
can test your system by selecting it with the SceneData dialog open.

Also note that you can manually update the SceneData dialog by pressing [F5]
when the dialog has focus. Otherwise it updates auto (after the above described
delay) when the SpecialEffectsViewer renders the current effect. The dialog will
always open initially without showing any information since I couldn't get that
to work reliably.

Note also that not all events in an effect are actually instantiated as objects
in the display-panel, and that conversely an event can instantiate into several
objects. That is the relation of events to objects is not necessarily 1:1 ...
