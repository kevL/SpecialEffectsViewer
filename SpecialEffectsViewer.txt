The repository of the currently selected effect is shown on the titlebar.

The special effect file (.sef) without extension is listed in the rightside
panel. Click a file in the list to play or replay it.


MENUS

Resrepo (resource repository)
-------
list all effects - lists all available effects
stock only       - lists stock effects only (installation data folder)
module only      - lists module-level effects (if a module is loaded)
campaign only    - lists campaign-level effects (if a module with a campaign is
                   loaded)
override only    - lists effects in override only

Note: Those aren't absolute determinations; Module, Campaign, and Override check
merely for a substring in each effect's path: "modules", "campaigns", or
"override" respectively. Stock checks merely for the absence of those strings.

I might try to figure it out for real later ...

Events
------
Play - plays or replays the currently selected effect's enabled events
Stop - stops play

Note: Only the option DoubleCharacter lists and allows disabling individual
effect-events. The following items appear on the menu only if DoubleCharacter
has been selected:

Disable all events - disables all events
Enable all events  - re-enables all events

If and only if the DoubleCharacter option is selected does a list of events
appear in the menu. The events can be toggled on or off with a click. Keypress
[Shift] when clicking to play only that event. I had to sacrifice a chicken to
get that to work ...

OPTIONS

When View|show Options panel is activated, several options are shown at the top
of the panel. The three radio-buttons select how the scene will be rendered:

Double character     - renders the scene with two NPCs. This creates source
                       and target creatures, and uses their attachment-nodes if
                       appropriate.
Single character     - renders the scene with a single NPC. This applies the
                       currently selected effect to a single creature using its
                       'AppearanceSEF' property
placed effect object - renders the effect on a placed-effect object

Note: Deciding which option above to use depends on the special effect file and
the usage that you intend to put it to for NwN2 play.

show Ground - toggles the ground on and off. Some effect-events have textures that
              only render on the ground

The currently selected effect's events will be listed beneath those options.
They are simply informational and can't be edited here; if you want to edit a
special effect or any of its events, breakout the files (they are listed) and
open them in the stock VFXEditor plugin or other.


BUTTONS

Clear - clears the scene
Copy  - copies the label of the currently selected special effect file to the
        Windows clipboard
Close - closes the plugin

filtr - toggles the effects-list filter on and off. Enter a string in search and
        click the filter button to set a filter-string. A filtered list can
        still be searched by typing a different string in search. To apply a
        different filter, enter a different string and toggle the filter button.
        The filter respects the currently selected Resrep and vice versa


MOUSE

RMB-drag           - pans the camera up/down/left/right
RMB-drag + Control - rotates the camera around its focal point
Mousewheel         - zooms the camera in/out

Note: The display panel must be focused to adjust the camera.


KEYBOARD

Enter  - plays the currently selected effect if the effects list or the scene
         panel has focus. Searches if search is focused (Shift+Enter to search
         ascending), toggles the list filter if the filter button has focus
Escape - closes the plugin

Lightning doesn't appear to work too well and perhaps should be avoided.
