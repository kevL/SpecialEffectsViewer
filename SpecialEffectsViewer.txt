The location of the currently selected effect is shown on the titlebar.

The special effect file (.sef) without extension is listed in the rightside
panel.


MENUS

List
----
list all Fx        - lists all available effects
list stock only    - lists stock effects only (installation data folder)
list module only   - lists module-level effects (if a module is loaded)
list campaign only - lists campaign-level effects (if a module with a campaign
                     is loaded)
list override only - lists effects in override only

Note: Those aren't absolute determinations; Module, Campaign, and Override check
merely for a substring in each effect's path: "modules", "campaigns", or
"override" respectively. Stock checks merely for the absence of those strings.

I might try to figure it out for real later ...

Events
------
Play - plays or replays the currently loaded effect's enabled events.

Note: Only the option DoubleCharacter lists and allows disabling individual
effect-events. The following items appear on the menu only if DoubleCharacter
has been selected:

Disable all events - disables all events
Enable all events  - re-enables all events

If and only if the DoubleCharacter option is selected does a list of events
appear in the menu. The events can be toggled on or off with a click. Keypress
[Shift] when clicking to play only that event. I had to sacrifice a chicken to
get this to work ...

View
----
stay on top        - keeps the plugin on top of the toolset when enabled
show Options panel - shows a panel on the left that has several options and
                     lists the currently loaded effect's events

Note: The details for each event are not always comprehensive. Some types of
events have LOTS of parameters. Do what it takes to open the effect in the stock
VFXEditor if you want to see (and edit) parameters exhaustively.

Help
----
help  - opens this textfile via Windows file-type association
about - opens a dialog with version and date of build


OPTIONS

When View|show Options panel is activated, several options are shown at the top
of the panel. The three radio-buttons select how the scene will be rendered:

Double character     - renders the scene with two NPCs. This creates source
                       and target creatures, and uses their attachment-nodes if
                       appropriate.
Single character     - renders the scene with a single NPC. This applies the
                       currently selected effect to a single creature using its
                       'AppearanceSEF' property
Placed effect object - renders the effect on a placed-effect object

Note: Deciding which option above to use depends on the special effect file and
the usage that you intend to put it to for NwN2 play.

Ground - toggles the ground on and off. Some effect-events have textures that
         only render on the ground

The currently selected effect's events will be listed beneath those options.
They are simply informational and can't be edited here; if you want to edit a
special effect or any of its events, breakout the files (they are listed) and
open them in the stock VFXEditor plugin.


BUTTONS

Clear - clears the scene
Copy  - copies the label of the currently selected special effect file to the
        Windows clipboard
Close - closes the plugin

filtr - toggles the effects-list filter on and off. Enter a string in search and
        click the filter button to set a filter-string. A filtered list can
        still be searched by typing a different string in search. To apply a
        different filter, enter a different string and toggle the filter button
        on and off. Note that the filter respects the currently selected List
