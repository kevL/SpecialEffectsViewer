INSTALLATION
------------

Open the toolset and enable 3rd party plugins. Close toolset.

Copy SpecialEffectsViewer.dll and SpecialEffectsViewer.txt to

  <installation>\Neverwinter Nights 2\NWN2Toolset\Plugins

The .dll is the plugin and the .txt file is its helpfile. The helpfile is not
required but can be opened with [F1].



CREDIT
------
codepoetz' PowerBar plugin for getting the code started.
The stock VFXEditor plugin for helping things along.

and whoever obfuscated all strings and private identifiers in the toolset DLLs -
you did a really good job.
